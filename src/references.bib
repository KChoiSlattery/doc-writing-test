    abstract = {Self-configuration in wireless sensor networks is a general class of estimation problems that we study via the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Specifically, we consider sensor location estimation when sensors measure received signal strength (RSS) or time-of-arrival (TOA) between themselves and neighboring sensors. A small fraction of sensors in the network have a known location, whereas the remaining locations must be estimated. We derive CRBs and maximum-likelihood estimators (MLEs) under Gaussian and log-normal models for the TOA and RSS measurements, respectively. An extensive TOA and RSS measurement campaign in an indoor office area illustrates MLE performance. Finally, relative location estimation algorithms are implemented in a wireless sensor network testbed and deployed in indoor and outdoor environments. The measurements and testbed experiments demonstrate 1-m RMS location errors using TOA, and 1- to 2-m RMS location errors using RSS.},

    abstract = {In this article, we present a distributed and decentralized synchronization algorithm for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The proposed method achieves subnanosecond synchronization using low-cost commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) software-defined radios (SDRs) and is implemented entirely in software without the need for custom hardware or atomic clocks. In an N sensor network, the proposed protocol results in each sensor having full knowledge of baseband clock offsets, RF carrier phase offsets, and pairwise RF time of flight to subnanosecond precision for the entire network after 2N total transmissions, making this method efficiently extendible to larger sensor networks. The method is decentralized and does not rely on a hierarchical master-slave structure, making it robust to sensor dropout in contested or harsh environments. The proposed methodology is validated in simulation and tested in field experiments using a three-sensor network. This work has a wide range of applications, including transmit (TX) beamforming, distributed sensor localization, and coherent multistatic/multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar imaging for autonomous sensor swarms.},
